# HandX

> *Hand of Developer* - Inspired by "Hand of the King" from Game of Thrones

## What is HandX?

HandX is your intelligent development agent that works on your computer or server while you command it from anywhere - even your mobile phone.

Like the Hand of the King serves the throne, HandX serves the developer.
